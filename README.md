# C CodeVault 🚀

Welcome to **C CodeVault**, a collection of mini projects and exercises developed using **C Programming**. This vault serves as a showcase of my learning journey, where I experimented with various concepts of C, from basic data structures to system-level programming.

Here, you’ll find everything from **ATM simulators** to **car rental systems**—all built using C! It's a mix of fun and functional projects to demonstrate my problem-solving skills and coding capabilities.
